# Phyloreferencing Curation Tool

The Phyloreferencing Curation Tool is designed to allow users to curate [phyloreferences]
side-by-side with the phylogenies they were originally defined on. The curated phylogenies
are stored in the [Phyx format], which can be downloaded as an [OWL 2 ontology]
in the [JSON-LD format]. Phyx files can be incorporated into the [Clade Ontology].
