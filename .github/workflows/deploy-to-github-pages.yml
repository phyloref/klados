name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow will be triggered when:
#   - A new release is published, whether as a full release or a
#     pre-release. Draft releases will not trigger this workflow
#     until they are published.
#
# This workflow will:
#   - Check out the code that is being published.
#   - Build the HTML and JS using Vue CLI.
#   - Deploy that code to the gh-pages branch using an SSH deploy
#     key. This key is stored as an encrypted secret in the repository.
